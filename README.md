# Tox Client Guidelines.
===
This git repo contains the documentation for the suggestions and recommendations a model Tox client would follow. As
with any client, you don't have to follow them as most are merely recommendation however if you do not only will your
users will thank you, but other clients won't hate you either!

Additionally, some client quarks are also detailed to make interaction a little enigmatic.

All suggestions and contributions from other clients (or any community member) are always welcome! To suggest a change
to this or any of the other docs available make a pull request at (GitHub)[https://github.com/irungentoo/Tox_Client_Guidelines]

## Hierarchy of recommendations.
The docs in this repo are sorted into different folders by how important it is that clients to follow them:

### Required:
Your client must follow these or else using it with other clients in Tox will be very difficult or impossible. Ignoring
these WILL make other dev's curse your very existence, and your users abandon you!

### Important:
Your client must follow these but not following them won't make it impossible to use with other clients. It might cause
some headaches for your users, and you'll likely be shunned by other dev's, or at the very least... mocked relentlessly.

### Recommendations:
These are general recommendations, strictly speaking these aren't yet standard, but it's what everyone else does... Your
client should follow these for optimal compatibility with the other *cool* clients. And don't you want to be cool too?!

### Suggestions:
These are some quarks or procedures that other clients tend to use. The docs here will never break compatibility, and
it's likely that any client that does use these will likely change for something better. But it can't hurt to follow
them so you should at least check them out.

Also included are some general ideas that will endear you to you users!
